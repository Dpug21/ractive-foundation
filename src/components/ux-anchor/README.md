> Create anchors in your application

`&lt;ux-anchor&gt;` is an internal helper component created for ractive-foundation.

It will throw custom events (with custom data) by the use of the attribute `customEvent` e.g.

`&lt;ux-anchor customEvent="myEvent:myData1,myData2" â€¦ &gt;content&lt;/ux-anchor&gt;`
